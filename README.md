# EmbeddingOfGraphs
Simple experiments for the above

There are three notebooks:

* **expander**: build feature based on each node's expanding properties (i.e. BFS)
* **simpleWalk**: very simple walks, for comparison
* **classify**: gather different embeddings and compare classification results

We use two datasets (with balanced binary classes): NCI1 and NCI109.
